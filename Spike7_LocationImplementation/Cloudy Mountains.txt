Chocolate River
You've arrived to a flowy river of chocolatey goodness.
There is a clearing to your LEFT I wonder what's over there..
Oh, theres a forest up AHEAD as well..
Name
Fairy Clearing
Wow it's like a sanctuary here.
You see an open area in what seems like a fog made up of fairy dust...
Up AHEAD there's a large mountain..
Name
Fern Forest
You're surrounded by trees so thick you can barely make out what's 50 feet in front of you...
You have an ominous feeling creeping up your spine..
"There must be fairies here.." you think to yourself.
To your RIGHT you see an opening to a creek?...
Name
Candy Mountain
Candy candy everywhere! You feel like you're in heaven..
but is this the real deal or just a dream?...
BEHIND you there's what seems like a river...a brown river?...
Name
Molten Creek
You see a flowing body of what seems to be...lava?...
What is this place...
BEHIND you there's a forest..maybe you should retreat..
